Bare metal programming on ARM Cortex-M0+ using 
[SparkFun RedBoard Turbo](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14812).

The repo contains code oriented towards embedded systems using *RedBoard
Turbo* as the hardware platform. The guides provide details for those wishing 
to learn more about embedded and bare metal programming.

## Quickstarts 
- [`c`](https://github.com/vafeond/BareMetalCapers/blob/main/c/README.md)
- [`Rust`](https://github.com/vafeond/BareMetalCapers/blob/main/rust/README.md)

## Guides

## Why?
Building something from scratch is great fun and a great learning experience. 
With an abundance of cheap hardware, and free software, documentation, 
and community support, a "from scratch" microcontroller software project is
more accessible than ever.

"Bare metal" and "from scratch" compliment nicely. You can't get much more
"from scratch" when starting with just a microcontroller, its datasheet, 
and a compiler (or assembler if really keen).

So, I'm doing this for fun and to exercise the embedded muscles and 
prevent/reverse attrophy. But, I also recognize I routinely stand on the 
shoulders of giants when using freely available software; therefore I put this 
out there for anyone who might find it useful.
